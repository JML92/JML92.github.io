<h2 class="header1">Foo Fighters</h2>
<p class="info1">In 1995, after the suicide of Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain, Dave Grohl took to the studio and recorded an album of songs recorded entirely by himself. To tour alongside the album, Dave enlisted William Goldsmith on drums, Nate Mendel on bass, and Pat Smear on guitar. Singles "This Is A Call", "Big Me", and "I'll Stick Around" led the album and garnered Dave Grohl's venture that started as a one-man band into a full-fledged outfit.

<h2 class="header2">The Colour and the Shape</h2>
<p class="info2">In 1997, after going through a divorce, Dave Grohl and bandmates Nate Mendel, Pat Smear, and William Goldsmith recorded their first full record together as a band. The initial recording sessions weren't productive. Dave ended up re-recording William's drum takes and using his own tracks instead. Once Goldsmith learned of this, he shortly after left the band.</p>
