<p class="info1">In 1999, the third Foo Fighters' album was released. Dave Grohl made the decision to record the album in his home studio which led to a more laid-back and alternative sound. Dave Grohl has gone on record and said that this might be the favorite Foo Fighters album they've made.</p>

<p id="end" class="info2">In 2002, the Foo Fighters gained Chris Shiflett on lead guitar after holding auditions. Returning to the studio, the band had a difficult time with the initial sessions of the album. After restarting, they eventually ended up with the finished product. This album had a darker, more rock-driven direction. </p>
