<p class="info1">In 2011, the Foo Fighters released their seventh studio album. It was recorded not only in Dave Grohl's garage but also to analog tape. No digital recording or ProTools was used during the making of the album and tape had to be spliced and cut to edit the music - the old-school way!</p>
